# IPL-MATCH-PREDICTOR
This repository contains the implementation of a data-driven IPL match prediction system that uses machine learning algorithms to predict the outcome of IPL matches. The system leverages historical data, performs data pre-processing, and applies various machine learning models to improve prediction accuracy.

# Project Overview
The IPL Match Prediction System is designed to predict the outcome of Indian Premier League (IPL) cricket matches based on historical match data. It includes:
Data pre-processing for cleaning and transforming the dataset.
Feature engineering to select relevant features impacting match outcomes.
Model selection and tuning to optimize predictive performance.

# Technologies Used
Jupyter Notebook: Development environment
NumPy: For numerical operations
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis
Scikit-learn: For machine learning model implementation
